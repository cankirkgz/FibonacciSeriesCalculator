<h1>Fibonacci Series Calculator</h1>

<p>This program calculates and displays the Fibonacci series based on the number of elements specified by the user.</p>

<h2>Fibonacci Series</h2>

<p>The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The series continues indefinitely.</p>

<p>Example Fibonacci series with 9 elements: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34</p>
